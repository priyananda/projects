	<ul>
		<li> Your goal is to collect 6 infinity stones. Each team must choose what stone they want
			to attempt for every question.
		<li> 6 Questions. +10 (and a stone) if the team gets a question right.
		<li> If a team gets all six stones, they can trigger a 'Snap', which will halve all the other
			teams scores.
