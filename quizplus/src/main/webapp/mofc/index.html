	There are more classes and extraneous tags than needed, and in a real world situation, it's more

	However, I think we can all agree that even given that, we're still better off than if this had been
	built with tables.

			<h3><span>Women granted the vote in New Zealand</span></h3>
			<p class="p1"><span>
			In the late nineteenth century the women's suffrage movement was widespread throughout Northern Europe, America, Britain and its colonies. But the first self-governing country to grant all women the vote was New Zealand on the 19th September 1893.
      So how did New Zealand manage to grant all women, including indigenous Maori women, the vote decades before other countries? Although some US states were early to extend the right to vote to women (Wyoming 1869, Utah 1870), the next country after New Zealand was Finland in 1907, then part of the Russian Empire. Many other countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States didn’t bring in women’s suffrage until after World War I.

			<h3><span >New Thing Called Baseball</span></h3>
      <p class="p1">
      <span>
      References to baseball date back to the 1700s where in England
      it was known as a game called rounders. Rounders is referenced in 1744
      in the children's book A Little Pretty Pocket-Book where it was called
      Baseball. In 1871 the first professional league, the National Association
      of Professional Base Ball Players, was founded. Five years later, the
      National League was created; it was followed by the American League in 1901.
      The first World Series between the champions of the two major leagues was
      held in 1903, and by 1905 it became an annual event.
